My latest collaborative piece is finished! Check out the video by Andrewism that explores "How Library Economies Work" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW5EVNT--DA

I love how Andrew pushes boundaries to imagine new ways of living in the modern era.

Thanks everyone for supporting this art series! Try to imagine what things in your daily life could be part of a library economy. It's a fun exercise to imagine what things could be shared instead of collected.
