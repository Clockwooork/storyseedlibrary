If you're interested in contributing to this website, you can create a pull request in its [Github repository](https://github.com/pawelngei/storyseedlibrary), contact the curator on [Mastodon](https://writing.exchange/@alxd) or by [email](mailto:storyseedlibrary@alxd_PLEASE_DELETE_THIS_CAPTION_.org) (read the address carefully please)!

We do not accept AI-generated submissions or ones using AI assets.

In some cases we might reject the submission based on its topic and themes. The Library focuses on realistic and slightly-fantastical representations of climate futures, so floating islands or generation ships might not be a good fit.
